# NOTE: Read the config.ini file in each of the plugin folders to understand what options are available to add here.
# DO NOT MODIFY THE config.ini FILE IN THE plugin FOLDER
# instead, copy the key from the plugin's config.ini file and put it under the section for the plugin below and then add
# your own value. For example, to change the unit type for the weather plugin from the default of imperial, put the
# unit_type key under the (existing) [openweathermap] section and set it to metric so it looks like this:

# [openweathermap]
# ... some settings ...
# unit_type = metric
# ... other settings ...

# This is so you can have multiple versions of the same plugin (you just add another section to this file with the
# "class" key pointing to the plugin class).

# If you don't want a particular plugin to show on your screen at all, remove (or comment out) that section IN THIS FILE.
# THis file is loaded up with all the plugins enabled so you can see them, but they can easily be modified/removed just by
# editing this file.

[DEFAULT]
# Any options in this [DEFAULT] section can also be added to each individual section to customize only that plugin.
#    Some options, like "autoswitch_timer" only apply to full screen plugins and other options like "widget_height"
#    only apply to widgets.
